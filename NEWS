metansue v2.6 (Release date: 2024-08-02)
========================================

Small update to fit current CRAN standards.

metansue v2.5 (Release date: 2022-09-12)
========================================

Changes:

* Bugs fixed: the meta-analysis can include only one (known or unknown) effect size.


metansue v2.4 (Release date: 2020-04-12)
========================================

Changes:

* Bugs fixed: the meta-analysis can include only one known and one unknown effect size.


metansue v2.3 (Release date: 2018-12-10)
========================================

Changes:

* Improved estimation of the recommended height of the forest plot.


metansue v2.2 (Release date: 2018-07-11)
========================================

Changes:

* Objects of class "nsue" include now the function to calculate the variance from the effect size, the function to multiply impute, and the function to back-transform. This allows users to create their own objects of class "nsue" for effect sizes not included in the package.
* The funnel function now plots the studies with NSUEs as smooths dots representing several imputations.
* For "visual" compatibility with standard meta-analyses, heterogeneity test now reports a Q statistic (instead of an F statistic).
* Function "z_from_r" has been renamed as "zcor_from_r".
* Adjustment for repeated measures and functions "r_in_smd_from_t_means_and_sds1" and "r_in_smd_from_t_means_and_sds2" have been discontinued, please use older releases of the package to use them.


metansue v2.1 (Release date: 2018-03-13)
========================================

Changes:

* Improved calculation of the pooled covariance matrix.


metansue v2.0 (Release date: 2017-07-21)
========================================

Changes:

* Several improvements in robustness. These changes imply that "data" argument is no longer required, that a single hypothesis can be specified in "meta", and that the following functions for "meta.nsue" objects have been removed: "linearHypothesis", "metalm" and "subset".
* Added "subset" function for objects of class "nsue".
* Default number of imputations has been increased to 500.


metansue v1.2 (Release date: 2016-08-31)
========================================

Changes:

* Bugs fixed: study labels can be numeric, correlation forest can have no NSUEs.


metansue v1.1 (Release date: 2016-06-20)
========================================

Changes:

* Added "r_in_smd_from_t_means_and_sds" and "subset" functions.


metansue v1.0 (Release date: 2015-11-11)
========================================

First version.
